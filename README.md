# CyberX-Terminal
CyberX Terminal ‚Äì Next-Gen OSINT Toolkit CyberX Terminal is a flashy, hacker-style Python tool designed for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts. It brings two powerful reconnaissance features into one futuristic terminal environment, making information gathering faster, easier, and visually impressive.
üõ†Ô∏è What is CyberX Terminal?
CyberX Terminal is a flashy hacker-style Python tool designed to combine two powerful OSINT features in one place:

Sherlock Username Lookup

Searches a given username across hundreds of websites.

Helps you find where a username is registered online.

Useful for recon and footprinting in ethical hacking.

HaveIBeenPwned Email Breach Checker

Checks if an email appears in known data breaches or leaks.

Lets you know if an account was compromised in past hacks.

Uses the official HaveIBeenPwned API, requiring a free API key.

‚ö° How It Works
Step 1: The user opens CyberX Terminal.

Step 2: The terminal shows a hacker-style neon banner with menu options:

1 ‚Üí Username Lookup (Sherlock)

2 ‚Üí Email Breach Check (HaveIBeenPwned)

3 ‚Üí Run Both

4 ‚Üí Exit

Step 3: The tool performs the scan and saves results in /results/ folder.

Step 4: Users can analyze where their usernames are found or if their emails are leaked.
